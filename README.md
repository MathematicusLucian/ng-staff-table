My keyboard is broken. The 'r' key is gone, so I have to copy and paste 'r' from Sublime notepad each time I use this, but needs must - had to complete the test.

Iâ€™ll use Angular Material... array as data source.... renderRows after updating array on button click... simply pass the three values in... add some nice CSS animations etc if time.  

Table on test is always empty on load, naturally, as the data souce array is empty.

You do not request any TDD, and I was rushing to achieve the 30 minutes limit, but I am quickly seeing if I can add some tests with Karma.

The placeholders are in Material default location, which I presume is ok, as they are conventional and the sketch is a rough description of work required. Likewise, if this was an actual live project, I would need to confirm the button location - must it actually float right, because such doesn't seem to be in keeping with a typical Material layout.  

The validation is not requested by your scope but I have added some anyway as time permits, but with a 30 minute limit, I have not fiddled with it as much as I would like - I was going to add error messages, but this is beyond you scope, and somewhat redundant if the button is only visible if the fields have valid content - the form is intuitive.
